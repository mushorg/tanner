TANNER
======

<b>He who flays the hide


Basic Concept
-------------

- Evaluating [SNARE](https://github.com/mushorg/snare) events.
- Serve dorks.
- Adopt and change the responses.


Getting Started
---------------

- You need Python3. We tested primarily with >=3.4
- This was tested with a recent Ubuntu based Linux.



1. Get TANNER: `git clone https://github.com/mushorg/tanner.git`
2. Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run TANNER: `sudo python3 server.py --interface localhost`

You obviously want to bind to 0.0.0.0 when running in <i>production</i> and on a different host than SNARE (recommended).
